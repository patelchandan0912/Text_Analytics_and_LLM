       "['THE PRESIDENT: Hello, Poland! One of our great allies.President Duda, Prime Minister — Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Mayor, and to all the former ministers and presidents, as well as mayors and Polish political leaders from all across the country: Thank you for welcoming me back to Poland.You know, it was nearly one year ago, nearly one year ago I spoke at the Royal Castle here in Warsaw, just weeks after Vladimir Putin had unleashed his murderous assault on Ukraine. The largest land war in Europe since World War Two had begun. And the principles that had been the cornerstone of peace, prosperity, and stability on this planet for more than 75 years were at risk of being shattered.One year ago, the world was bracing for the fall of Kyiv.Well, I have just come from a visit to Kyiv, and I can report: Kyiv stands strong! Kyiv stands proud. It stands tall.And most important, it stands free.When Russia invaded, it wasn’t just Ukraine being tested.The whole world faced a test for the ages.Europe was being tested. America was being tested.NATO was being tested. All democracies were being tested.And the questions we faced were as simple as they were profound.Would we respond or would we look the other way?Would we be strong or would we be weak? Would be — we would — would we be — all of our allies — would be united or divided?One year later, we know the answer.We did respond. We would be strong.We would be united. And the world would not look the other way.We also faced fundamental questions about the commitment to the most basic of principles.Would we stand up for the sovereignty of nations? Would we stand up for the right of people to live free from naked aggression? Would we stand up for democracy?One year later, we know the answers.Yes, we would stand up for sovereignty.And we did.Yes, we would stand up for the right of people to live free from aggression. And we did.And we would stand up for democracy. And we did.And yesterday, I had the honor to stand with President Zelenskyy in Kyiv to declare that we will keep standing up for these same things no matter what.When President Putin ordered his tanks to roll into Ukraine, he thought we would roll over.He was wrong.The Ukrainian people are too brave.America, Europe, a coalition of nations from the Atlantic to the Pacific — we were too unified.Democracy was too strong.Instead of an easy victory he perceived and predicted, Putin left with burnt-out tanks and Russia’s forces in delay — in disarray.He thought he’d get the Finlandization of NATO. Instead, he got the NATOization of Finland — and Sweden.He thought NATO would fracture and divide. Instead, NATO is more united and more unified than ever — than ever before.He thought he could weaponize energy to crack your resolve — Europe’s resolve.Instead, we’re working together to end Europe’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels.He thought autocrats like himself were tough and leaders of democracies were soft.And then, he met the iron will of America and the nations everywhere that refused to accept a world governed by fear and force.He found himself at war with a nation led by a man whose courage would be forged in fire and steel: President Zelenskyy.President Putin — President Putin is confronted with something today that he didn’t think was possible a year ago. The democracies of the world have grown stronger, not weaker. But the autocrats of the world have grown weaker, not stronger.Because in the moments of great upheaval and uncertainty, that knowing what you stand for is most important, and knowing who stands with you makes all the difference.The people of Poland know that.You know that.In fact, you know — you know it better than anyone here in Poland. Because that’s what solidarity means.Through partition and oppression, when the beautiful city was destroyed after the Warsaw Uprising, during decades under the iron fist of communist rule, Poland endured because you stood together.That’s how the brave leaders of the opposition and the people of Belarus continue to fight for their democracy.That’s how the resolve of Moldovan people — (applause) — resolve of the people of Moldova to live in freedom gained them independence and put them on the path to EU membership.President Sandu is here today. I’m not sure where she is. But I’m proud to stand with you and the freedom-loving people of Moldova.Give her a round of applause.One year into this war, Putin no longer doubts the strength of our coalition. But he still doubts our conviction. He doubts our staying power.He doubts our continued support for Ukraine. He doubts whether NATO can remain unified.But there should be no doubt: Our support for Ukraine will not waver, NATO will not be divided, and we will not tire.President Putin’s craven lust for land and power will fail.And the Ukrainian people’s love for their country will prevail.Democracies of the world will stand guard over freedom today, tomorrow, and forever.For that’s what — that’s what’s at stake here: freedom.That’s the message I carried to Kyiv yesterday, directly to the people of Ukraine.When President Zelenskyy said — he came to the United States in December — quote — he said this struggle will define the world and what our children and grandchildren — how they live, and then their children and grandchildren.He wasn’t only speaking about the children and grandchildren of Ukraine. He was speaking about all of our children and grandchildren.Yours and mine.We’re seeing again today what the people of Poland and the people all across Europe saw for decades: Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.They must be opposed.Autocrats only understand one word: “No.” “No.” “No.”“No, you will not take my country.” “No, you will not take my freedom.” “No, you will not take my future.”And I’ll repeat tonight what I said last year in this same place: A dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never be able to erase the people’s love of liberty. Brutality will never grind down the will of the free. And Ukraine — Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia. Never.For free people refuse to live in a world of hopelessness and darkness.You know, this has been an extraordinary year in every sense.Extraordinary brutality from Russian forces and mercenaries. They have committed depravities, crimes against humanity, without shame or compunction.They’ve targeted civilians with death and destruction.Used rape as a weapon of war.Stolen Ukrainian children in an attempt to — in an attempt to steal Ukraine’s future. Bombed train stations, maternity hospitals, schools, and orphanages.No one — no one can turn away their eyes from the atrocities Russia is committing against the Ukrainian people. It’s abhorrent. It’s abhorrent.But extraordinarily, as well, has been the response of the Ukrainian people and the world.One year after the bombs began to fall and Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, Ukraine is still independent and free.From Kherson to Kharkiv, Ukrainian fighters have reclaimed their land.In more than 50 percent of the territory Russia held last year, the blue and the yellow flag of Ukraine proudly waves once again.President Zelenskyy still leads a democratically elected government that represents the will of the Ukrainian people.And the world has already voted multiple times, including in the United Nations General Assembly, to condemn Russia’s aggression and support a just peace.Each time in the U.N., that vote has been overwhelming.In October, 143 nations in the United Nations condemned Russia’s illegal annexation. Only four — four in the entire U.N. — voted with Russia. Four.So, tonight, I speak once more to the people of Russia.The United States and the nations of Europe do not seek to control or destroy Russia.The West was not plotting to attack Russia, as Putin said today. And millions of Russian citizens who only want to live in peace with their neighbors are not the enemy.This war was never a necessity; it’s a tragedy.President Putin chose this war.Every day the war continues is his choice. He could end the war with a word.It’s simple. If Russia stopped invading Ukraine, it would end the war. If Ukraine stopped defending itself against Russia, it would be the end of Ukraine.That’s why, together, we’re making sure Ukraine can defend itself.The United States has assembled a worldwide coalition of more than 50 nations to get critical weapons and supplies to the brave Ukrainian fighters on the frontlines. Air defense systems, artillery, ammunition, tanks, and armored vehicles.The European Union and its member states have stepped up with unprecedented commitment to Ukraine, not just in security assistance, but economic, and humanitarian, refugee assistance, and so much more.To all of you here tonight: Take a moment. And I’m serious when I say this: Turn on and look — turn around and look at one another. Look at what you’ve done so far.Poland is hosting more than 1.5 million refugees from this war. God bless you.Poland’s generosity, your willingness to open your hearts and your homes, is extraordinary.And the American people are united in our resolve as well.All across my country, in big cities and small towns, Ukrainian flags fly from American homes.Over the past year, Democrats and Republicans in our United States Congress have come together to stand for freedom.That’s who Americans are, and that’s what Americans do.The world is also coming together to address the global fallout from President Putin’s war.Putin tried to starve the world, blocking the ports in the Black Sea to stop Ukraine from exporting its grain, exacerbating the global food crisis that hit developing nations in Africa especially hard.Instead, the United States and the G7 and partners around the world answered the call with historic commitments to address the crisis and to bolster global food supplies.And this week, my wife, Jill Biden, is traveling to Africa to help bring attention to this critical issue.Our commitment is to the people of Ukraine and the future of Ukraine — a Ukraine that’s free, sovereign, and democratic.That was the dream of those who declared Ukraine’s independence more than 30 years ago — who led the Orange Revolution and the Revolution of Dignity; who braved ice and fire on the Maidan and the Heavenly Hundred who died there; and those who continue still to root out Kremlin’s efforts to corrupt, coerce, and control.It’s a dream for those Ukrainian patriots who have fought for years against Russia’s aggressions in the Donbas and the heroes who have given everything, given their lives, in the service of their beloved Ukraine.I was honored to visit their memorial in Kyiv yesterday to pay tribute to the sacrifice of those who lost their lives, standing alongside President Zelenskyy.The United States and our partners stand with Ukraine’s teachers, its hospital staff, its emergency responders, the workers in cities across Ukraine who are fighting to keep the power on in the face of Russia’s cruel bombardment.We stand with the millions of refugees of this war who have found a welcome in Europe and the United States, particularly here in Poland.Ordinary people all across Europe did whatever they could to help and continue to do so.Polish businesses, civil society, cultural leaders — including the First Lady of Poland, who is here tonight — have led with the heart and determination, showcasing all that’s good about the human spirit.Madam First Lady, we love you. Thank you all.I’ll never forget, last year, visiting with refugees from Ukraine who had just arrived in Warsaw, seeing their faces exhausted and afraid — holding their children so close, worrying they might never see their fathers, their husbands, their brothers or sisters again.In that darkest moment of their lives, you, the people of Poland, offered them safety and light.You embraced them.You literally embraced them.I watched.I watched the looks on their faces.Meanwhile, together we have made sure that Russia is paying the price for its abuses.We continue to maintain the largest sanctions regime ever imposed on any country in history.And we’re going to announce more sanctions this week together with our partners.We’ll hold accountable those who are responsible for this war. And we will seek justice for the war crimes and crimes against humanity continuing to be committed by the Russians.You know, there is much for us to be proud of over the — all that we have achieved together this past year.But we have to be honest and cleared-eyed as we look at the year ahead.The defense of freedom is not the work of a day or of a year.It’s always difficult.It’s always important.As Ukraine continues to defend itself against the Russian onslaught and launch counter-offensives of its own, there will continue to be hard and very bitter days, victories and tragedies.But Ukraine is steeled for the fight ahead.And the United States, together with our Allies and partners, are going to continue to have Ukraine’s back as it defends itself.Next year, I will host every member of NATO for our 2024 summit in the United States.Together, we’ll celebrate the 75th anniversary of the strongest defensive alliance in the history of the world — NATO.And let there be no doubt, the commitment of the United States to our NATO Alliance and Article 5 is rock solid.And every member of NATO knows it. And Russia knows it as well.An attack against one is an attack against all.It’s a sacred oath.A sacred oath to defend every inch of NATO territory.Over the past year, the United States has come together with our Allies and partners in an extraordinary coalition to stand against Russian aggression.But the work in front of us is not just what we’re against, it’s about what we’re for.What kind of world do we want to build?We need to take the strength and capacity of this coalition and apply it to lifting up — lifting up the lives of people everywhere, improving health, growing prosperity, preserving the planet, building peace and security, treating everyone with dignity and respect.That’s our responsibility. The democracies of the world have to deliver it for our people.As we gather tonight, the world, in my view, is at an — at an inflection point. The decisions we make over the next five years or so are going to determine and shape our lives for decades to come.That’s true for Americans.It’s true for the people of the world.And while decisions are ours to make now, the principles and the stakes are eternal. A choice between chaos and stability.Between building and destroying. Between hope and fear. Between democracy that lifts up the human spirit and the brutal hand of the dictator who crushes it.Between nothing less than limitation and possibilities, the kind of possibilities that come when people who live not in captivity but in freedom. Freedom.Freedom. There is no sweeter word than freedom.There is no nobler goal than freedom.There is no higher aspiration than freedom.Americans know that, and you know it. And all that we do now must be done so our children and grandchildren will know it as well.Freedom.The enemy of the tyrant and the hope of the brave and the truth of the ages.Freedom.Stand with us. We will stand with you.Let us move forward with faith and conviction and with an abiding commitment to be allies not of darkness, but of light.Not of oppression, but of liberation.Not of captivity, but, yes, of freedom.May God bless you all.May God protect our troops. And may God bless the heroes of Ukraine and all those who defend freedom around the world.Thank you, Poland.Thank you, thank you, thank you for what you’re doing.God bless you all.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Speaker. Madam Vice President. Our First Lady and Second Gentleman.Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Leaders of our military.Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, and retired Justices of the Supreme Court.And you, my fellow Americans.I start tonight by congratulating the members of the 118th Congress and the new Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy.Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working together.I also want to congratulate the new leader of the House Democrats and the first Black House Minority Leader in history, Hakeem Jeffries.Congratulations to the longest serving Senate Leader in history, Mitch McConnell.And congratulations to Chuck Schumer for another term as Senate Majority Leader, this time with an even bigger majority.And I want to give special recognition to someone who I think will be considered the greatest Speaker in the history of this country, Nancy Pelosi.The story of America is a story of progress and resilience. Of always moving forward. Of never giving up.A story that is unique among all nations.We are the only country that has emerged from every crisis stronger than when we entered it.That is what we are doing again.Two years ago, our economy was reeling.As I stand here tonight, we have created a record 12 million new jobs, more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four years.Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much.Today, COVID no longer controls our lives.And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War.Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.As we gather here tonight, we are writing the next chapter in the great American story, a story of progress and resilience. When world leaders ask me to define America, I define our country in one word: Possibilities.You know, we’re often told that Democrats and Republicans can’t work together.But over these past two years, we proved the cynics and the naysayers wrong.Yes, we disagreed plenty. And yes, there were times when Democrats had to go it alone.But time and again, Democrats and Republicans came together.Came together to defend a stronger and safer Europe.Came together to pass a once-in-a-generation infrastructure law, building bridges to connect our nation and people.Came together to pass one of the most significant laws ever, helping veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.In fact, I signed over 300 bipartisan laws since becoming President. From reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, to the Electoral Count Reform Act, to the Respect for Marriage Act that protects the right to marry the person you love.To my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is no reason we can’t work together in this new Congress.The people sent us a clear message. Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.And that’s always been my vision for our country. To restore the soul of the nation. To rebuild the backbone of America, the middle class. To unite the country.We’ve been sent here to finish the job.For decades, the middle class was hollowed out.Too many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas. Factories at home closed down.Once-thriving cities and towns became shadows of what they used to be.And along the way, something else was lost.Pride. That sense of self-worth.I ran for President to fundamentally change things, to make sure the economy works for everyone so we can all feel pride in what we do.To build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well.As my Dad used to say, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, “Honey—it’s going to be OK,” and mean it.So, let’s look at the results. Unemployment rate at 3.4%, a 50-year low. Near record low unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers.We’ve already created 800,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs, the fastest growth in 40 years.Where is it written that America can’t lead the world in manufacturing again?For too many decades, we imported products and exported jobs.Now, thanks to all we’ve done, we’re exporting American products and creating American jobs.Inflation has been a global problem because of the pandemic that disrupted supply chains and Putin’s war that disrupted energy and food supplies.But we’re better positioned than any country on Earth.We have more to do, but here at home, inflation is coming down.Here at home, gas prices are down $1.50 a gallon since their peak.Food inflation is coming down.Inflation has fallen every month for the last six months while take home pay has gone up.Additionally, over the last two years, a record 10 million Americans applied to start a new small business.Every time somebody starts a small business, it’s an act of hope.And the Vice President will continue her work to ensure more small businesses can access capital and the historic laws we enacted.Standing here last year, I shared with you a story of American genius and possibility.Semiconductors, the small computer chips the size of your fingertip that power everything from cellphones to automobiles, and so much more. These chips were invented right here in America.America used to make nearly 40% of the world’s chips.But in the last few decades, we lost our edge and we’re down to producing only 10%. We all saw what happened during the pandemic when chip factories overseas shut down.Today’s automobiles need up to 3,000 chips each, but American automakers couldn’t make enough cars because there weren’t enough chips.Car prices went up. So did everything from refrigerators to cellphones.We can never let that happen again.That’s why we came together to pass the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act.We’re making sure the supply chain for America begins in America.We’ve already created 800,000 manufacturing jobs even without this law.With this new law, we will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs across the country.That’s going to come from companies that have announced more than $300 billion in investments in American manufacturing in the last two years.Outside of Columbus, Ohio, Intel is building semiconductor factories on a thousand acres – a literal field of dreams.That’ll create 10,000 jobs. 7,000 construction jobs. 3,000 jobs once the factories are finished.Jobs paying $130,000 a year, and many don’t require a college degree.Jobs where people don’t have to leave home in search of opportunity.And it’s just getting started.Think about the new homes, new small businesses, and so much more that will come to life.Talk to mayors and Governors, Democrats and Republicans, and they’ll tell you what this means to their communities.We’re seeing these fields of dreams transform the heartland.But to maintain the strongest economy in the world, we also need the best infrastructure in the world.We used to be #1 in the world in infrastructure, then we fell to #13th.Now we’re coming back because we came together to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the largest investment in infrastructure since President Eisenhower’s Interstate Highway System.Already, we’ve funded over 20,000 projects, including at major airports from Boston to Atlanta to Portland.These projects will put hundreds of thousands of people to work rebuilding our highways, bridges, railroads, tunnels, ports and airports, clean water, and high-speed internet across America.Urban. Suburban. Rural. Tribal.And we’re just getting started. I sincerely thank my Republican friends who voted for the law.And to my Republican friends who voted against it but still ask to fund projects in their districts, don’t worry.I promised to be the president for all Americans.We’ll fund your projects. And I’ll see you at the ground-breaking.This law will help further unite all of America.Major projects like the Brent Spence bridge between Kentucky and Ohio over the Ohio River. Built 60 years ago. Badly in need of repairs.One of the nation’s most congested freight routes carrying $2 billion worth of freight every day. Folks have been talking about fixing it for decades, but we’re finally going to get it done.I went there last month with Democrats and Republicans from both states to deliver $1.6 billion for this project.While I was there, I met an ironworker named Sara, who is here tonight.For 30 years, she’s been a proud member of Ironworkers Local 44, known as the “cowboys of the sky” who built the Cincinnati skyline.Sara said she can’t wait to be ten stories above the Ohio River building that new bridge. That’s pride.That’s what we’re also building—Pride.We’re also replacing poisonous lead pipes that go into 10 million homes and 400,000 schools and childcare centers, so every child in America can drink clean water.We’re making sure that every community has access to affordable, high-speed internet.No parent should have to drive to a McDonald’s parking lot so their kid can do their homework online.And when we do these projects, we’re going to Buy American.Buy American has been the law of the land since 1933. But for too long, past administrations have found ways to get around it.Not anymore.Tonight, I’m also announcing new standards to require all construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects to be made in America.American-made lumber, glass, drywall, fiber optic cables.And on my watch, American roads, American bridges, and American highways will be made with American products.My economic plan is about investing in places and people that have been forgotten. Amid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible.Maybe that’s you, watching at home.You remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away.I get it.That’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind.Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back, because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.For example, too many of you lay in bed at night staring at the ceiling, wondering what will happen if your spouse gets cancer, your child gets sick, or if something happens to you.Will you have the money to pay your medical bills? Will you have to sell the house?I get it. With the Inflation Reduction Act that I signed into law, we’re taking on powerful interests to bring your health care costs down so you can sleep better at night.You know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any major country on Earth.For example, one in ten Americans has diabetes.Every day, millions need insulin to control their diabetes so they can stay alive. Insulin has been around for 100 years. It costs drug companies just $10 a vial to make.But, Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars—and making record profits.Not anymore.We capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare.But there are millions of other Americans who are not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with Type I diabetes who need insulin to save their lives.Let’s finish the job this time.Let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it.This law also caps out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at a maximum $2,000 per year when there are in fact many drugs, like expensive cancer drugs, that can cost up to $10,000, $12,000, and $14,000 a year.If drug prices rise faster than inflation, drug companies will have to pay Medicare back the difference.And we’re finally giving Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices. Bringing down prescription drug costs doesn’t just save seniors money.It will cut the federal deficit, saving tax payers hundreds of billions of dollars on the prescription drugs the government buys for Medicare.Why wouldn’t we want to do that?Now, some members here are threatening to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act.Make no mistake, if you try to do anything to raise the cost of prescription drugs, I will veto it.I’m pleased to say that more Americans have health insurance now than ever in history.A record 16 million people are enrolled under the Affordable Care Act.Thanks to the law I signed last year, millions are saving $800 a year on their premiums.But the way that law was written, that benefit expires after 2025.Let’s finish the job, make those savings permanent, and expand coverage to those left off Medicaid.Look, the Inflation Reduction Act is also the most significant investment ever to tackle the climate crisis.Lowering utility bills, creating American jobs, and leading the world to a clean energy future.I’ve visited the devastating aftermaths of record floods and droughts, storms, and wildfires.In addition to emergency recovery from Puerto Rico to Florida to Idaho, we are rebuilding for the long term.New electric grids able to weather the next major storm.Roads and water systems to withstand the next big flood.Clean energy to cut pollution and create jobs in communities too often left behind.We’re building 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations installed across the country by tens of thousands of IBEW workers.And helping families save more than $1,000 a year with tax credits for the purchase of electric vehicles and energy-efficient appliances.Historic conservation efforts to be responsible stewards of our lands.Let’s face reality.The climate crisis doesn’t care if your state is red or blue. It is an existential threat.We have an obligation to our children and grandchildren to confront it. I’m proud of how America is at last stepping up to the challenge.But there’s so much more to do.We will finish the job.And we pay for these investments in our future by finally making the wealthiest and the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share.I’m a capitalist. But just pay your fair share.And I think a lot of you at home agree with me that our present tax system is simply unfair.The idea that in 2020, 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40 billion in profits and paid zero in federal income taxes?That’s simply not fair.But now, because of the law I signed, billion-dollar companies have to pay a minimum of 15%.Just 15%.That’s less than a nurse pays. Let me be clear.Under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in taxes.Nobody. Not one penny.But there’s more to do.Let’s finish the job. Reward work, not just wealth. Pass my proposal for a billionaire minimum tax.Because no billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighter.You may have noticed that Big Oil just reported record profits.Last year, they made $200 billion in the midst of a global energy crisis.It’s outrageous.They invested too little of that profit to increase domestic production and keep gas prices down.Instead, they used those record profits to buy back their own stock, rewarding their CEOs and shareholders.Corporations ought to do the right thing.That’s why I propose that we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks to encourage long term investments instead.They will still make a considerable profit.Let’s finish the job and close the loopholes that allow the very wealthy to avoid paying their taxes.Instead of cutting the number of audits of wealthy tax payers, I signed a law that will reduce the deficit by $114 billion by cracking down on wealthy tax cheats.That’s being fiscally responsible.In the last two years, my administration cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion—the largest deficit reduction in American history.Under the previous administration, America’s deficit went up four years in a row.Because of those record deficits, no president added more to the national debt in any four years than my predecessor.Nearly 25% of the entire national debt, a debt that took 200 years to accumulate, was added by that administration alone.How did Congress respond to all that debt?They lifted the debt ceiling three times without preconditions or crisis.They paid America’s bills to prevent economic disaster for our country.Tonight, I’m asking this Congress to follow suit.Let us commit here tonight that the full faith and credit of the United States of America will never, ever be questioned.Some of my Republican friends want to take the economy hostage unless I agree to their economic plans. All of you at home should know what their plans are.Instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset every five years.That means if Congress doesn’t vote to keep them, those programs will go away.Other Republicans say if we don’t cut Social Security and Medicare, they’ll let America default on its debt for the first time in our history.I won’t let that happen.Social Security and Medicare are a lifeline for millions of seniors.Americans have been paying into them with every single paycheck since they started working.So tonight, let’s all agree to stand up for seniors. Stand up and show them we will not cut Social Security. We will not cut Medicare.Those benefits belong to the American people. They earned them.If anyone tries to cut Social Security, I will stop them. And if anyone tries to cut Medicare, I will stop them.I will not allow them to be taken away.Not today. Not tomorrow. Not ever.Next month when I offer my fiscal plan, I ask my Republican friends to offer their plan.We can sit down together and discuss both plans together.My plan will lower the deficit by $2 trillion.I won’t cut a single Social Security or Medicare benefit.In fact, I will extend the Medicare Trust Fund by at least two decades.I will not raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year. And I will pay for the ideas I’ve talked about tonight by making the wealthy and big corporations begin to pay their fair share.Look, here’s the deal. Big corporations aren’t just taking advantage of the tax code. They’re taking advantage of you, the American consumer.Here’s my message to all of you out there: I have your back. We’re already preventing insurance companies from sending surprise medical bills, stopping 1 million surprise bills a month.We’re protecting seniors’ lives and life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit fraud, endanger patient safety, or prescribe drugs they don’t need.Millions of Americans can now save thousands of dollars because they can finally get hearing aids over-the-counter without a prescription.Capitalism without competition is not capitalism. It is exploitation.Last year I cracked down on foreign shipping companies that were making you pay higher prices for everyday goods coming into our country.I signed a bipartisan bill that cut shipping costs by 90%, helping American farmers, businesses, and consumers.Let’s finish the job.Pass bipartisan legislation to strengthen antitrust enforcement and prevent big online platforms from giving their own products an unfair advantage.My administration is also taking on “junk” fees, those hidden surcharges too many businesses use to make you pay more.For example, we’re making airlines show you the full ticket price upfront and refund your money if your flight is cancelled or delayed.We’ve reduced exorbitant bank overdraft fees, saving consumers more than $1 billion a year.We’re cutting credit card late fees by 75%, from $30 to $8.Junk fees may not matter to the very wealthy, but they matter to most folks in homes like the one I grew up in. They add up to hundreds of dollars a month.They make it harder for you to pay the bills or afford that family trip.I know how unfair it feels when a company overcharges you and gets away with it.Not anymore.We’ve written a bill to stop all that. It’s called the Junk Fee Prevention Act.We’ll ban surprise “resort fees” that hotels tack on to your bill. These fees can cost you up to $90 a night at hotels that aren’t even resorts.We’ll make cable internet and cellphone companies stop charging you up to $200 or more when you decide to switch to another provider.We’ll cap service fees on tickets to concerts and sporting events and make companies disclose all fees upfront.And we’ll prohibit airlines from charging up to $50 roundtrip for families just to sit together.Baggage fees are bad enough—they can’t just treat your child like a piece of luggage.Americans are tired of being played for suckers.Pass the Junk Fee Prevention Act so companies stop ripping us off.For too long, workers have been getting stiffed.Not anymore.We’re beginning to restore the dignity of work.For example, 30 million workers had to sign non-compete agreements when they took a job. So a cashier at a burger place can’t cross the street to take the same job at another burger place to make a couple bucks more.Not anymore.We’re banning those agreements so companies have to compete for workers and pay them what they’re worth.I’m so sick and tired of companies breaking the law by preventing workers from organizing.Pass the PRO Act because workers have a right to form a union. And let’s guarantee all workers a living wage.Let’s also make sure working parents can afford to raise a family with sick days, paid family and medical leave, and affordable child care that will enable millions more people to go to work.Let’s also restore the full Child Tax Credit, which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half, to the lowest level in history.And by the way, when we do all of these things, we increase productivity. We increase economic growth.Let’s also finish the job and get more families access to affordable and quality housing.Let’s get seniors who want to stay in their homes the care they need to do so. And give a little more breathing room to millions of family caregivers looking after their loved ones.Pass my plan so we get seniors and people with disabilities the home care services they need and support the workers who are doing God’s work.These plans are fully paid for and we can afford to do them.Restoring the dignity of work also means making education an affordable ticket to the middle class.When we made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated, best-prepared nation in the world.But the world has caught up.Jill, who teaches full-time, has an expression: “Any nation that out-educates us will out-compete us.”Folks, you all know 12 years is not enough to win the economic competition for the 21st Century.If you want America to have the best-educated workforce, let’s finish the job by providing access to pre-school for 3- and 4-year-olds.Studies show that children who go to pre-school are nearly 50% more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a 2- or 4-year degree, no matter their background.Let’s give public school teachers a raise.And we’re making progress by reducing student debt and increasing Pell Grants for working- and middle-class families.Let’s finish the job, connect students to career opportunities starting in high school and provide two years of community college, some of the best career training in America, in addition to being a pathway to a four-year degree.Let’s offer every American the path to a good career whether they go to college or not.And folks, in the midst of the COVID crisis when schools were closed, let’s also recognize how far we’ve come in the fight against the pandemic itself.While the virus is not gone, thanks to the resilience of the American people, we have broken COVID’s grip on us.COVID deaths are down nearly 90%.We’ve saved millions of lives and opened our country back up.And soon we’ll end the public health emergency.But we will remember the toll and pain that will never go away for so many. More than 1 million Americans have lost their lives to COVID.Families grieving. Children orphaned. Empty chairs at the dining room table.We remember them, and we remain vigilant.We still need to monitor dozens of variants and support new vaccines and treatments.So Congress needs to fund these efforts and keep America safe.And as we emerge from this crisis stronger, I’m also doubling down on prosecuting criminals who stole relief money meant to keep workers and small businesses afloat during the pandemic.Before I came to office many inspector generals who protect taxpayer dollars were sidelined. Fraud was rampant.Last year, I told you the watchdogs are back. Since then, we’ve recovered billions of taxpayer dollars.Now, let’s triple our anti-fraud strike forces going after these criminals, double the statute of limitations on these crimes, and crack down on identity fraud by criminal syndicates stealing billions of dollars from the American people.For every dollar we put into fighting fraud, taxpayers get back at least ten times as much.COVID left other scars, like the spike in violent crime in 2020, the first year of the pandemic.We have an obligation to make sure all our people are safe.Public safety depends on public trust. But too often that trust is violated.Joining us tonight are the parents of Tyre Nichols, who had to bury him just last week. There are no words to describe the heartbreak and grief of losing a child.But imagine what it’s like to lose a child at the hands of the law.Imagine having to worry whether your son or daughter will come home from walking down the street or playing in the park or just driving their car.I’ve never had to have the talk with my children—Beau, Hunter, and Ashley—that so many Black and Brown families have had with their children.If a police officer pulls you over, turn on your interior lights. Don’t reach for your license. Keep your hands on the steering wheel.Imagine having to worry like that every day in America.Here’s what Tyre’s mom shared with me when I asked her how she finds the courage to carry on and speak out.With faith in God, she said her son “was a beautiful soul and something good will come from this.”Imagine how much courage and character that takes.It’s up to us. It’s up to all of us.We all want the same thing.Neighborhoods free of violence.Law enforcement who earn the community’s trust.Our children to come home safely.Equal protection under the law; that’s the covenant we have with each other in America.And we know police officers put their lives on the line every day, and we ask them to do too much.To be counselors, social workers, psychologists; responding to drug overdoses, mental health crises, and more.We ask too much of them.I know most cops are good, decent people. They risk their lives every time they put on that shield.But what happened to Tyre in Memphis happens too often.We have to do better.Give law enforcement the training they need, hold them to higher standards, and help them succeed in keeping everyone safe.We also need more first responders and other professionals to address growing mental health and substance abuse challenges.More resources to reduce violent crime and gun crime; more community intervention programs; more investments in housing, education, and job training.All this can help prevent violence in the first place.And when police officers or departments violate the public’s trust, we must hold them accountable.With the support of families of victims, civil rights groups, and law enforcement, I signed an executive order for all federal officers banning chokeholds, restricting no-knock warrants, and other key elements of the George Floyd Act.Let’s commit ourselves to make the words of Tyre’s mother come true, something good must come from this.All of us in this chamber, we need to rise to this moment.We can’t turn away.Let’s do what we know in our hearts we need to do.Let’s come together and finish the job on police reform.Do something.That was the same plea of parents who lost their children in Uvalde: Do something on gun violence.Thank God we did, passing the most sweeping gun safety law in three decades.That includes things that the majority of responsible gun owners support, like enhanced background checks for 18 to 21-year-olds and red flag laws keeping guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves and others.But we know our work is not done.Joining us tonight is Brandon Tsay, a 26-year-old hero.Brandon put off his college dreams to stay by his mom’s side as she was dying from cancer. He now works at a dance studio started by his grandparents.Two weeks ago, during Lunar New Year celebrations, he heard the studio’s front door close and saw a man pointing a gun at him.He thought he was going to die, but then he thought about the people inside.In that instant, he found the courage to act and wrestled the semi-automatic pistol away from a gunman who had already killed 11 people at another dance studio.He saved lives. It’s time we do the same as well.Ban assault weapons once and for all.We did it before. I led the fight to ban them in 1994.In the 10 years the ban was law, mass shootings went down. After Republicans let it expire, mass shootings tripled.Let’s finish the job and ban assault weapons again.And let’s also come together on immigration and make it a bipartisan issue like it was before.We now have a record number of personnel working to secure the border, arresting 8,000 human smugglers and seizing over 23,000 pounds of fentanyl in just the last several months.Since we launched our new border plan last month, unlawful migration from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela has come down 97%.But America’s border problems won’t be fixed until Congress acts.If you won’t pass my comprehensive immigration reform, at least pass my plan to provide the equipment and officers to secure the border. And a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers.Here in the people’s House, it’s our duty to protect all the people’s rights and freedoms.Congress must restore the right the Supreme Court took away last year and codify Roe v. Wade to protect every woman’s constitutional right to choose.The Vice President and I are doing everything we can to protect access to reproductive health care and safeguard patient privacy. But already, more than a dozen states are enforcing extreme abortion bans.Make no mistake; if Congress passes a national abortion ban, I will veto it.Let’s also pass the bipartisan Equality Act to ensure LGBTQ Americans, especially transgender young people, can live with safety and dignity.Our strength is not just the example of our power, but the power of our example. Let’s remember the world is watching.I spoke from this chamber one year ago, just days after Vladimir Putin unleashed his brutal war against Ukraine.A murderous assault, evoking images of the death and destruction Europe suffered in World War II.Putin’s invasion has been a test for the ages. A test for America. A test for the world.Would we stand for the most basic of principles?Would we stand for sovereignty?Would we stand for the right of people to live free from tyranny?Would we stand for the defense of democracy?For such a defense matters to us because it keeps the peace and prevents open season for would-be aggressors to threaten our security and prosperity. One year later, we know the answer.Yes, we would.And yes, we did.Together, we did what America always does at our best.We led.We united NATO and built a global coalition.We stood against Putin’s aggression.We stood with the Ukrainian people.Tonight, we are once again joined by Ukraine’s Ambassador to the United States. She represents not just her nation, but the courage of her people.Ambassador, America is united in our support for your country. We will stand with you as long as it takes.Our nation is working for more freedom, more dignity, and more peace, not just in Europe, but everywhere.Before I came to office, the story was about how the People’s Republic of China was increasing its power and America was falling in the world.Not anymore.I’ve made clear with President Xi that we seek competition, not conflict.I will make no apologies that we are investing to make America strong. Investing in American innovation, in industries that will define the future, and that China’s government is intent on dominating.Investing in our alliances and working with our allies to protect our advanced technologies so they’re not used against us.Modernizing our military to safeguard stability and deter aggression.Today, we’re in the strongest position in decades to compete with China or anyone else in the world.I am committed to work with China where it can advance American interests and benefit the world.But make no mistake: as we made clear last week, if China’s threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did.And let’s be clear: winning the competition with China should unite all of us. We face serious challenges across the world.But in the past two years, democracies have become stronger, not weaker.Autocracies have grown weaker, not stronger.America is rallying the world again to meet those challenges, from climate and global health, to food insecurity, to terrorism and territorial aggression.Allies are stepping up, spending more and doing more.And bridges are forming between partners in the Pacific and those in the Atlantic. And those who bet against America are learning just how wrong they are.It’s never a good bet to bet against America.When I came to office, most everyone assumed bipartisanship was impossible. But I never believed it.That’s why a year ago, I offered a Unity Agenda for the nation.We’ve made real progress.Together, we passed a law making it easier for doctors to prescribe effective treatments for opioid addiction.Passed a gun safety law making historic investments in mental health.Launched ARPA-H to drive breakthroughs in the fight against cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and so much more.We passed the Heath Robinson PACT Act, named for the late Iraq war veteran whose story about exposure to toxic burn pits I shared here last year.But there is so much more to do. And we can do it together.Joining us tonight is a father named Doug from Newton, New Hampshire.He wrote Jill and me a letter about his daughter Courtney. Contagious laugh. Her sister’s best friend.He shared a story all too familiar to millions of Americans.Courtney discovered pills in high school. It spiraled into addiction and eventually her death from a fentanyl overdose.She was 20 years old.Describing the last eight years without her, Doug said, “There is no worse pain.”Yet their family has turned pain into purpose, working to end stigma and change laws.He told us he wants to “start the journey towards America’s recovery.”Doug, we’re with you.Fentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year.Let’s launch a major surge to stop fentanyl production, sale, and trafficking, with more drug detection machines to inspect cargo and stop pills and powder at the border.Working with couriers like Fed Ex to inspect more packages for drugs. Strong penalties to crack down on fentanyl trafficking.Second, let’s do more on mental health, especially for our children. When millions of young people are struggling with bullying, violence, trauma, we owe them greater access to mental health care at school.We must finally hold social media companies accountable for the experiment they are running on our children for profit.And it’s time to pass bipartisan legislation to stop Big Tech from collecting personal data on kids and teenagers online, ban targeted advertising to children, and impose stricter limits on the personal data these companies collect on all of us.Third, let’s do more to keep our nation’s one truly sacred obligation: to equip those we send into harm’s way and care for them and their families when they come home.Job training and job placement for veterans and their spouses as they return to civilian life.Helping veterans afford their rent because no one should be homeless in this country, especially not those who served it.And we cannot go on losing 17 veterans a day to the silent scourge of suicide.The VA is doing everything it can, including expanding mental health screenings and a proven program that recruits veterans to help other veterans understand what they’re going through and get the help they need.And fourth, last year Jill and I re-ignited the Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead in our Administration.Our goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years. Turn more cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases. And provide more support for patients and families.It’s personal for so many of us.Joining us are Maurice and Kandice, an Irishman and a daughter of immigrants from Panama.They met and fell in love in New York City and got married in the same chapel as Jill and I did.Kindred spirits.He wrote us a letter about their little daughter Ava.She was just a year old when she was diagnosed with a rare kidney cancer.26 blood transfusions. 11 rounds of radiation. 8 rounds of chemo. 1 kidney removed.A 5% survival rate.He wrote how in the darkest moments he thought, “if she goes, I can’t stay.”Jill and I understand, like so many of you.They read how Jill described our family’s cancer journey and how we tried to steal moments of joy where you can.For them, that glimmer of joy was a half-smile from their baby girl. It meant everything.They never gave up hope.Ava never gave up hope. She turns four next month.They just found out that Ava beat the odds and is on her way to being cancer free, and she’s watching from the White House tonight.For the lives we can save and for the lives we have lost, let this be a truly American moment that rallies the country and the world together and proves that we can do big things.Twenty years ago, under the leadership of President Bush and countless advocates and champions, we undertook a bipartisan effort through PEPFAR to transform the global fight against HIV/AIDS. It’s been a huge success.I believe we can do the same with cancer.Let’s end cancer as we know it and cure some cancers once and for all.There’s one reason why we’re able to do all of these things: our democracy itself.It’s the most fundamental thing of all.With democracy, everything is possible. Without it, nothing is.For the last few years our democracy has been threatened, attacked, and put at risk.Put to the test here, in this very room, on January 6th.And then, just a few months ago, unhinged by the Big Lie, an assailant unleashed political violence in the home of the then-Speaker of this House of Representatives. Using the very same language that insurrectionists who stalked these halls chanted on January 6th.Here tonight in this chamber is the man who bears the scars of that brutal attack, but is as tough and strong and as resilient as they get.My friend, Paul Pelosi.But such a heinous act never should have happened.We must all speak out. There is no place for political violence in America. In America, we must protect the right to vote, not suppress that fundamental right. We honor the results of our elections, not subvert the will of the people. We must uphold the rule of the law and restore trust in our institutions of democracy.And we must give hate and extremism in any form no safe harbor.Democracy must not be a partisan issue. It must be an American issue.Every generation of Americans has faced a moment where they have been called on to protect our democracy, to defend it, to stand up for it.And this is our moment.My fellow Americans, we meet tonight at an inflection point. One of those moments that only a few generations ever face, where the decisions we make now will decide the course of this nation and of the world for decades to come.We are not bystanders to history. We are not powerless before the forces that confront us. It is within our power, of We the People. We are facing the test of our time and the time for choosing is at hand.We must be the nation we have always been at our best. Optimistic. Hopeful. Forward-looking.A nation that embraces, light over darkness, hope over fear, unity over division. Stability over chaos.We must see each other not as enemies, but as fellow Americans. We are a good people, the only nation in the world built on an idea.That all of us, every one of us, is created equal in the image of God. A nation that stands as a beacon to the world. A nation in a new age of possibilities.So I have come here to fulfil my constitutional duty to report on the state of the union. And here is my report.Because the soul of this nation is strong, because the backbone of this nation is strong, because the people of this nation are strong, the State of the Union is strong.As I stand here tonight, I have never been more optimistic about the future of America. We just have to remember who we are.We are the United States of America and there is nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together.May God bless you all. May God protect our troops.',\n",
       " 'Thank you.Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, my fellow leaders, in the last year, our world has experienced great upheaval: a growing crisis in food insecurity; record heat, floods, and droughts; COVID-19; inflation; and a brutal, needless war—a war chosen by one man, to be very blunt.Let us speak plainly. A permanent member of the United Nations Security Council invaded its neighbor, attempted to erase a sovereign state from the map.Russia has shamelessly violated the core tenets of the United Nations Charter—no more important than the clear prohibition against countries taking the territory of their neighbor by force.Again, just today, President Putin has made overt nuclear threats against Europe and a reckless disregard for the responsibilities of the non-proliferation regime.Now Russia is calling—calling up more soldiers to join the fight. And the Kremlin is organizing a sham referenda to try to annex parts of Ukraine, an extremely significant violation of the U.N. Charter.This world should see these outrageous acts for what they are. Putin claims he had to act because Russia was threatened. But no one threatened Russia, and no one other than Russia sought conflict.In fact, we warned it was coming. And with many of you, we worked to try to avert it.Putin’s own words make his true purpose unmistakable. Just before he invaded, Putin asserted—and I quote—Ukraine was “created by Russia” and never had, quote, “real statehood.”And now we see attacks on schools, railway stations, hospitals, wa-—on centers of Ukrainian history and culture.In the past, even more horrifying evidence of Russia’s atrocity and war crimes: mass graves uncovered in Izyum; bodies, according to those that excavated those bodies, showing signs of torture.This war is about extinguishing Ukraine’s right to exist as a state, plain and simple, and Ukraine’s right to exist as a people. Whoever you are, wherever you live, whatever you believe, that should not—that should make your blood run cold.That’s why 141 nations in the General Assembly came together to unequivocally condemn Russia’s war against Ukraine. The United States has marshaled massive levels of security assistance and humanitarian aid and direct economic support for Ukraine—more than $25 billion to date.Our allies and partners around the world have stepped up as well. And today, more than 40 countries represented in here have contributed billions of their own money and equipment to help Ukraine defend itself.The United States is also working closely with our allies and partners to impose costs on Russia, to deter attacks against NATO territory, to hold Russia accountable for the atrocities and war crimes.Because if nations can pursue their imperial ambitions without consequences, then we put at risk everything this very institution stands for. Everything.Every victory won on the battlefield belongs to the courageous Ukrainian soldiers. But this past year, the world was tested as well, and we did not hesitate.We chose liberty. We chose sovereignty. We chose principles to which every party to the United Nations Charter is beholding. We stood with Ukraine.Like you, the United States wants this war to end on just terms, on terms we all signed up for: that you cannot seize a nation’s territory by force. The only country standing in the way of that is Russia.So, we—each of us in this body who is determined to uphold the principles and beliefs we pledge to defend as members of the United Nations—must be clear, firm, and unwavering in our resolve.Ukraine has the same rights that belong to every sovereign nation. We will stand in solidarity with Ukraine. We will stand in solidarity against Russia’s aggression. Period.Now, it’s no secret that in the contest between democracy and autocracy, the United States—and I, as President—champion a vision for our world that is grounded in the values of democracy.The United States is determined to defend and strengthen democracy at home and around the world. Because I believe democracy remains humanity’s greatest instrument to address the challenges of our time.We’re working with the G7 and likeminded countries to prove democracies can deliver for their citizens but also deliver for the rest of the world as well.But as we meet today, the U.N. Charter—the U.N. Charter’s very basis of a stable and just rule-based order is under attack by those who wish to tear it down or distort it for their own political advantage.And the United Nations Charter was not only signed by democracies of the world, it was negotiated among citizens of dozens of nations with vastly different histories and ideologies, united in their commitment to work for peace.As President Truman said in 1945, the U.N. Charter—and I quote—is “proof that nations, like men, can state their differences, can face them, and then can find common ground on which to stand.” End of quote.That common ground was so straightforward, so basic that, today, 193 of you—193 member states—have willingly embraced its principles. And standing up for those principles for the U.N. Charter is the job of every responsible member state.I reject the use of violence and war to conquer nations or expand borders through bloodshed.To stand against global politics of fear and coercion; to defend the sovereign rights of smaller nations as equal to those of larger ones; to embrace basic principles like freedom of navigation, respect for international law, and arms control—no matter what else we may disagree on, that is the common ground upon which we must stand.If you’re still committed to a strong foundation for the good of every nation around the world, then the United States wants to work with you.I also believe the time has come for this institution to become more inclusive so that it can better respond to the needs of today’s world.Members of the U.N. Security Council, including the United States, should consistently uphold and defend the U.N. Charter and refrain—refrain from the use of the veto, except in rare, extraordinary situations, to ensure that the Council remains credible and effective.That is also why the United States supports increasing the number of both permanent and non-permanent representatives of the Council. This includes permanent seats for those nations we’ve long supported and permanent seats for countries in Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean.The United States is committed to this vital work. In every region, we pursued new, constructive ways to work with partners to advance shared interests, from elevating the Quad in the Indo-Pacific; to signing the Los Angeles Declaration of Migration and Protection at the Summit of the Americas; to joining a historic meeting of nine Arab leaders to work toward a more peaceful, integrated Middle East; to hosting the U.S.-Africa Leaders’ Summit in—this December.As I said last year, the United States is opening an era of relentless diplomacy to address the challenges that matter most to people’s lives—all people’s lives: tackling the climate crisis, as the previous speaker spoke to; strengthening global health security; feeding the world—feeding the world.We made that priority. And one year later, we’re keeping that promise.From the day I came to office, we’ve led with a bold climate agenda. We rejoined the Paris Agreement, convened major climate summits, helped deliver critical agreements on COP26. And we helped get two thirds of the world GDP on track to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.And now I’ve signed a historic piece of legislation here in the United States that includes the biggest, most important climate commitment we have ever made in the history of our country: $369 billion toward climate change. That includes tens of billions in new investments in offshore wind and solar, doubling down on zero emission vehicles, increasing energy efficiency, supporting clean manufacturing.Our Department of Energy estimates that this new law will reduce U.S. emissions by one gigaton a year by 2030 while unleashing a new era of clean-energy-powered economic growth.Our investments will also help reduce the cost of developing clean energy technologies worldwide, not just the United States. This is a global gamechanger—and none too soon. We don’t have much time.We all know we’re already living in a climate crisis. No one seems to doubt it after this past year. As we meet, much of Pakistan is still underwater; it needs help. Meanwhile, the Horn of Africa faces unprecedented drought.Families are facing impossible choices, choosing which child to feed and wondering whether they’ll survive.This is the human cost of climate change. And it’s growing, not lessening.So, as I announced last year, to meet our global responsibility, my administration is working with our Congress to deliver more than $11 billion a year to international climate finance to help lower-income countries implement their climate goals and ensure a just energy transition.The key part of that will be our PREPARE plan, which will help half a billion people, and especially vulnerable countries, adapt to the impacts of climate change and build resilience.This need is enormous. So let this be the moment we find within ourselves the will to turn back the tide of climate devastation and unlock a resilient, sustainable, clean energy economy to preserve our planet.On global health, we’ve delivered more than 620 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine to 116 countries around the world, with more available to help meet countries’ needs—all free of charge, no strings attached.And we’re working closely with the G20 and other countries. And the United States helped lead the change to establish a groundbreaking new Fund for Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness, and Response at the World Bank.At the same time, we’ve continued to advance the ball on enduring global health challenges.Later today, I’ll host the Seventh Replenishment Conference for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. With bipartisan support in our Congress, I have pledged to contribute up to $6 billion to that effort.So I look forward to welcoming a historic round of pledges at the conference resulting in one of the largest global health fundraisers ever held in all of history.We’re also taking on the food crisis head on. With as many as 193 million people around the world experiencing acute—acute food insecurity—a jump of 40 million in a year—today I’m announcing another $2.9 billion in U.S. support for lifesaving humanitarian and food security assistance for this year alone.Russia, in the meantime, is pumping out lies, trying to pin the blame for the crisis—the food crisis—onto sanctions imposed by many in the world for the aggression against Ukraine.So let me be perfectly clear about something: Our sanctions explicitly allow—explicitly allow Russia the ability to export food and fertilizer. No limitation. It’s Russia’s war that is worsening food insecurity, and only Russia can end it.I’m grateful for the work here at the U.N.—including your leadership, Mr. Secretary-General—establishing a mechanism to export grain from Black Sea ports in Ukraine that Russia had blocked for months, and we need to make sure it’s extended.We believe strongly in the need to feed the world. That’s why the United States is the world’s largest supporter of the World Food Programme, with more than 40 percent of its budget.We’re leading support—we’re leading support of the UNICEF efforts to feed children around the world.And to take on the larger challenge of food insecurity, the United States introduced a Call to Action: a roadmap eliminating global food insecurity—to eliminating global food insecurity that more than 100 nation member states have already supported.In June, the G7 announced more than $4.5 billion to strengthen food security around the world.Through USAID’s Feed the Future initiative, the United States is scaling up innovative ways to get drought- and heat-resistant seeds into the hands of farmers who need them, while distributing fertilizer and improving fertilizer efficiency so that farmers can grow more while using less.And we’re calling on all countries to refrain from banning food exports or hoarding grain while so many people are suffering. Because in every country in the world, no matter what else divides us, if parents cannot feed their children, nothing—nothing else matters if parents cannot feed their children.As we look to the future, we’re working with our partners to update and create rules of the road for new challenges we face in the 21st century.We launched the Trade and Technology Council with the European Union to ensure that key technologies—key technologies are developed and governed in the way that benefits everyone.With our partner countries and through the U.N., we’re supporting and strengthening the norms of responsibility—responsible state behavior in cyberspace and working to hold accountable those who use cyberattacks to threaten international peace and security.With partners in the Americas, Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, and the Indo-Pacific, we’re working to build a new economic ecosystem while—where every nation—every nation gets a fair shot and economic growth is resilient, sustainable, and shared.That’s why the United States has championed a global minimum tax. And we will work to see it implemented so major corporations pay their fair share everywhere—everywhere.It’s also been the idea behind the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which the United States launched this year with 13 other Indo-Pacific economies. We’re working with our partners in ASEAN and the Pacific Islands to support a vision for a critical Indo-Pacific region that is free and open, connected and prosperous, secure and resilient.Together with partners around the world, we’re working to secure resilient supply chains that protect everyone from coercion or domination and ensure that no country can use energy as a weapon.And as Russia’s war rolls the global economy, we’re also calling on major global creditors, including the non-Paris Club countries, to transparently negotiate debt forgiveness for lower-income countries to forestall broader economic and political crises around the world.Instead of infrastructure projects that generate huge and large debt without delivering on the promised advantages, let’s meet the enormous infrastructure needs around the world with transparent investments—high-standard projects that protect the rights of workers and the environment—keyed to the needs of the communities they serve, not to the contributor.That’s why the United States, together with fellow G7 partners, launched a Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. We intend to collectively mobilize $600 billion in investment through this partnership by 2027.Dozens of projects are already underway: industrial-scale vaccine manufacturing in Senegal, transformative solar projects in Angola, first-of-its-kind small modular nuclear power plant in Romania.These are investments that are going to deliver returns not just for those countries, but for everyone. The United States will work with every nation, including our competitors, to solve global problems like climate change. Climate diplomacy is not a favor to the United States or any other nation, and walking away hurts the entire world.Let me be direct about the competition between the United States and China. As we manage shifting geopolitical trends, the United States will conduct itself as a reasonable leader. We do not seek conflict. We do not seek a Cold War. We do not ask any nation to choose between the United States or any other partner.But the United States will be unabashed in promoting our vision of a free, open, secure, and prosperous world and what we have to offer communities of nations: investments that are designed not to foster dependency, but to alleviate burdens and help nations become self-sufficient; partnerships not to create political obligation, but because we know our own success—each of our success is increased when other nations succeed as well.When individuals have the chance to live in dignity and develop their talents, everyone benefits. Critical to that is living up to the highest goals of this institution: increasing peace and security for everyone, everywhere.The United States will not waver in our unrelenting determination to counter and thwart the continuing terrorist threats to our world. And we will lead with our diplomacy to strive for peaceful resolution of conflicts.We seek to uphold peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits.We remain committed to our One China policy, which has helped prevent conflict for four decades. And we continue to oppose unilateral changes in the status quo by either side.We support an African Union-led peace process to end the fight in Ethiopia and restore security for all its people.In Venezuela, where years of the political oppression have driven more than 6 million people from that country, we urge a Venezuelan-led dialogue and a return to free and fair elections.We continue to stand with our neighbor in Haiti as it faces political-fueled gang violence and an enormous human crisis.And we call on the world to do the same. We have more to do.We’ll continue to back the U.N.-mediated truce in Yemen, which has delivered precious months of peace to people that have suffered years of war.And we will continue to advocate for lasting negotiating peace between the Jewish and democratic state of Israel and the Palestinian people. The United States is committed to Israel’s security, full stop. And a negotiated two-state solution remains, in our view, the best way to ensure Israel’s security and prosperity for the future and give the Palestinians the state which—to which they are entitled—both sides to fully respect the equal rights of their citizens; both people enjoying equal measure of freedom and dignity.Let me also urge every nation to recommit to strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime through diplomacy. No matter what else is happening in the world, the United States is ready to pursue critical arms control measures. A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.The five permanent members of the Security Council just reaffirmed that commitment in January. But today, we’re seeing disturbing trends. Russia shunned the Non-Proliferation ideals embraced by every other nation at the 10th NPT Review Conference.And again, today, as I said, they’re making irresponsible nuclear threats to use nuclear weapons. China is conducting an unprecedented, concerning nuclear buildup without any transparency.Despite our efforts to begin serious and sustained diplomacy, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea continues to blatantly violate U.N. sanctions.And while the United States is prepared for a mutual return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action if Iran steps up to its obligations, the United States is clear: We will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.I continue to believe that diplomacy is the best way to achieve this outcome. The nonproliferation regime is one of the greatest successes of this institution. We cannot let the world now slide backwards, nor can we turn a blind eye to the erosion of human rights.Perhaps singular among this body’s achievements stands the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is the standard by which our forebears challenged us to measure ourselves.They made clear in 1948: Human rights are the basis for all that we seek to achieve. And yet today, in 2022, fundamental freedoms are at risk in every part of our world, from the violations of—in Xinjiang detailed in recent reports by the Office of U.N.—U.S.—reports detailing by the U.S. [U.N.] High Commissioner, to the horrible abuses against pro-democracy activists and ethnic minorities by the military regime in Burma, to the increased repression of women and girls by the Taliban in Afghanistan.And today, we stand with the brave citizens and the brave women of Iran who right now are demonstrating to secure their basic rights.But here’s what I know: The future will be won by those countries that unleash the full potential of their populations, where women and girls can exercise equal rights, including basic reproductive rights, and contribute fully to building a stronger economies and more resilient societies; where religious and ethnic minorities can live their lives without harassment and contribute to the fabric of their communities; where the LGBTQ+ community individuals live and love freely without being targeted with violence; where citizens can question and criticize their leaders without fear of reprisal.The United States will always promote human rights and the values enshrined in the U.N. Charter in our own country and around the world.Let me end with this: This institution, guided by the U.N. Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is at its core an act of dauntless hope.Let me say that again: It’s an act of dauntless hope.Think about the vision of those first delegates who undertook a seemingly impossible task while the world was still smoldering.Think about how divided the people of the world must have felt with the fresh grief of millions dead, the genocidal horrors of the Holocaust exposed.They had every right to believe only the worst of humanity. Instead, they reached for what was best in all of us, and they strove to build something better: enduring peace; comity among nations; equal rights for every member of the human family; cooperation for the advancement of all humankind.My fellow leaders, the challenges we face today are great indeed, but our capacity is greater. Our commitment must be greater still.So let’s stand together to again declare the unmistakable resolve that nations of the world are united still, that we stand for the values of the U.N. Charter, that we still believe by working together we can bend the arc of history toward a freer and more just world for all our children, although none of us have fully achieved it.We’re not passive witnesses to history; we are the authors of history.We can do this—we have to do it—for ourselves and for our future, for humankind.Thank you for your tolerance, for listening to me. I appreciate it very much. God bless you all.',\n",
       " 'THE PRESIDENT: My fellow Americans, please, if you have a seat, take it. I speak to you tonight from sacred ground in America: Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.This is where America made its Declaration of Independence to the world more than two centuries ago with an idea, unique among nations, that in America, we’re all created equal.This is where the United States Constitution was written and debated.This is where we set in motion the most extraordinary experiment of self-government the world has ever known with three simple words: “We, the People.”“We, the People.”These two documents and the ideas they embody—equality and democracy—are the rock upon which this nation is built.They are how we became the greatest nation on Earth. They are why, for more than two centuries, America has been a beacon to the world.But as I stand here tonight, equality and democracy are under assault.We do ourselves no favor to pretend otherwise.So tonight, I have come this place where it all began to speak as plainly as I can to the nation about the threats we face, about the power we have in our own hands to meet these threats, and about the incredible future that lies in front of us if only we choose it.We must never forget: We, the people, are the true heirs of the American experiment that began more than two centuries ago.We, the people, have burning inside each of us the flame of liberty that was lit here at Independence Hall—a flame that lit our way through abolition, the Civil War, Suffrage, the Great Depression, world wars, Civil Rights.That sacred flame still burns now in our time as we build an America that is more prosperous, free, and just.That is the work of my presidency, a mission I believe in with my whole soul.But first, we must be honest with each other and with ourselves.Too much of what’s happening in our country today is not normal.Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic.Now, I want to be very clear—very clear up front: Not every Republican, not even the majority of Republicans, are MAGA Republicans. Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology.I know because I’ve been able to work with these mainstream Republicans.But there is no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven, and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans, and that is a threat to this country.These are hard things.But I’m an American President—not the President of red America or blue America, but of all America.And I believe it is my duty—my duty to level with you, to tell the truth no matter how difficult, no matter how painful.And here, in my view, is what is true: MAGA Republicans do not respect the Constitution.They do not believe in the rule of law. They do not recognize the will of the people.They refuse to accept the results of a free election.And they’re working right now, as I speak, in state after state to give power to decide elections in America to partisans and cronies, empowering election deniers to undermine democracy itself.MAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards—backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love.They promote authoritarian leaders, and they fan the flames of political violence that are a threat to our personal rights, to the pursuit of justice, to the rule of law, to the very soul of this country.They look at the mob that stormed the United States Capitol on January 6th—brutally attacking law enforcement—not as insurrectionists who placed a dagger to the throat of our democracy, but they look at them as patriots.And they see their MAGA failure to stop a peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election as preparation for the 2022 and 2024 elections.They tried everything last time to nullify the votes of 81 million people.This time, they’re determined to succeed in thwarting the will of the people.That’s why respected conservatives, like Federal Circuit Court Judge Michael Luttig, has called Trump and the extreme MAGA Republicans, quote, a “clear and present danger” to our democracy.But while the threat to American democracy is real, I want to say as clearly as we can: We are not powerless in the face of these threats.We are not bystanders in this ongoing attack on democracy.There are far more Americans—far more Americans from every—from every background and belief who reject the extreme MAGA ideology than those that accept it.And, folks, it is within our power, it’s in our hands—yours and mine—to stop the assault on American democracy.I believe America is at an inflection point—one of those moments that determine the shape of everything that’s to come after.And now America must choose: to move forward or to move backwards?To build the future or obsess about the past?To be a nation of hope and unity and optimism, or a nation of fear, division, and of darkness?MAGA Republicans have made their choice. They embrace anger. They thrive on chaos. They live not in the light of truth but in the shadow of lies.But together—together, we can choose a different path. We can choose a better path.Forward, to the future. A future of possibility. A future to build and dream and hope.And we’re on that path, moving ahead.I know this nation. I know you, the American people. I know your courage. I know your hearts. And I know our history.This is a nation that honors our Constitution. We do not reject it.This is a nation that believes in the rule of law. We do not repudiate it.This is a nation that respects free and fair elections. We honor the will of the people.We do not deny it.And this is a nation that rejects violence as a political tool. We do not encourage violence.We are still an America that believes in honesty and decency and respect for others, patriotism, liberty, justice for all, hope, possibilities.We are still, at our core, a democracy.And yet history tells us that blind loyalty to a single leader and a willingness to engage in political violence is fatal to democracy.For a long time, we’ve told ourselves that American democracy is guaranteed, but it’s not.We have to defend it, protect it, stand up for it—each and every one of us.That’s why tonight I’m asking our nation to come together, unite behind the single purpose of defending our democracy regardless of your ideology.We’re all called, by duty and conscience, to confront extremists who will put their own pursuit of power above all else.Democrats, independents, mainstream Republicans: We must be stronger, more determined, and more committed to saving American democracy than MAGA Republicans are to—to destroying American democracy.We, the people, will not let anyone or anything tear us apart. Today, there are dangers around us we cannot allow to prevail. We hear—you’ve heard it—more and more talk about violence as an acceptable political tool in this country. It’s not. It can never be an acceptable tool.So I want to say this plain and simple: There is no place for political violence in America. Period. None. Ever.We saw law enforcement brutally attacked on January the 6th.We’ve seen election officials, poll workers—many of them volunteers of both parties—subjected to intimidation and death threats. And—can you believe it?—FBI agents just doing their job as directed, facing threats to their own lives from their own fellow citizens.On top of that, there are public figures—today, yesterday, and the day before—predicting and all but calling for mass violence and rioting in the streets.This is inflammatory. It’s dangerous. It’s against the rule of law. And we, the people, must say: This is not who we are.Ladies and gentlemen, we can’t be pro-insurrectionist and pro-American. They’re incompatible.We can’t allow violence to be normalized in this country. It’s wrong.We each have to reject political violence with all the moral clarity and conviction this nation can muster. Now.We can’t let the integrity of our elections be undermined, for that is a path to chaos.Look, I know politics can be fierce and mean and nasty in America. I get it. I believe in the give-and-take of politics, in disagreement and debate and dissent.We’re a big, complicated country. But democracy endures only if we, the people, respect the guardrails of the republic. Only if we, the people, accept the results of free and fair elections.Only if we, the people, see politics not as total war but mediation of our differences.Democracy cannot survive when one side believes there are only two outcomes to an election: either they win or they were cheated.And that’s where MAGA Republicans are today.They don’t understand what every patriotic American knows: You can’t love your country only when you win.It’s fundamental.American democracy only works only if we choose to respect the rule of law and the institutions that were set up in this chamber behind me, only if we respect our legitimate political differences.I will not stand by and watch—I will not—the will of the American people be overturned by wild conspiracy theories and baseless, evidence-free claims of fraud.I will not stand by and watch elections in this country stolen by people who simply refuse to accept that they lost.I will not stand by and watch the most fundamental freedom in this country—the freedom to vote and have your vote counted—and—be taken from you and the American people.Look, as your President, I will defend our democracy with every fiber of my being, and I’m asking every American to join me.Throughout our history, America has often made the greatest progress coming out of some of our darkest moments, like you’re hearing in that bullhorn.I believe we can and we must do that again, and we are.MAGA Republicans look at America and see carnage and darkness and despair. They spread fear and lies–-lies told for profit and power.But I see a very different America—an America with an unlimited future, an America that is about to take off. I hope you see it as well. Just look around.I believed we could lift America from the depths of COVID, so we passed the largest economic recovery package since Franklin Delano Roosevelt. And today, America’s economy is faster, stronger than any other advanced nation in the world.We have more to go.I believed we could build a better America, so we passed the biggest infrastructure investment since President Dwight D. Eisenhower. And we’ve now embarked on a decade of rebuildingthe nation’s roads, bridges, highways, ports, water systems, high-speed Internet, railroads.I believed we could make America safer, so we passed the most significant gun safety law since President Clinton.I believed we could go from being the highest cost of prescriptions in the world to making prescription drugs and healthcare more affordable, so we passed the most significant healthcare reforms since President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act.And I believed we could create—we could create a clean energy future and save the planet, so we passed the most important climate initiative ever, ever, ever.The cynics and the critics tell us nothing can get done, but they are wrong. There is not a single thing America cannot do—not a single thing beyond our capacity if we do it together.It’s never easy. But we’re proving that in America, no matter how long the road, progress does come.Look, I know the last year—few years have been tough. But today, COVID no longer controls our lives.More Americans are working than ever. Businesses are growing. Our schools are open.Millions of Americans have been lifted out of poverty. Millions of veterans once exposed to toxic burn pits will now get what they deserve for their families and the compensation.American manufacturing has come alive across the Heartland, and the future will be made in America—no matter what the white supremacists and the extremists say.I made a bet on you, the American people, and that bet is paying off.Proving that from darkness —the darkness of Charlottesville, of COVID, of gun violence, of insurrection—we can see the light. Light is now visible.Light that will guide us forward not only in words, but in actions—actions for you, for your children, for your grandchildren, for America.Even in this moment, with all the challenges we face, I give you my word as a Biden: I’ve never been more optimistic about America’s future.Not because of me, but because of who you are.We’re going to end cancer as we know it.Mark my words.We are going to create millions of new jobs in a clean energy economy.We’re going to think big.We’re going to make the 21st century another American century because the world needs us to.That’s where we need to focus our energy—not in the past, not on divisive culture wars, not on the politics of grievance, but on a future we can build together.The MAGA Republicans believe that for them to succeed, everyone else has to fail.They believe America—not like I believe about America.I believe America is big enough for all of us to succeed, and that is the nation we’re building: a nation where no one is left behind.I ran for President because I believed we were in a battle for the soul of this nation. I still believe that to be true. I believe the soul is the breath, the life, and the essence of who we are. The soul is what makes us “us.”The soul of America is defined by the sacred proposition that all are created equal in the image of God. That all are entitled to be treated with decency, dignity, and respect. That all deserve justice and a shot at lives of prosperity and consequence.And that democracy—democracy must be defended, for democracy makes all these things possible.Folks, and it’s up to us.Democracy begins and will be preserved in we, the people’s, habits of heart, in our character: optimism that is tested yet endures, courage that digs deep when we need it, empathy that fuels democracy, the willingness to see each other not as enemies but as fellow Americans.Look, our democracy is imperfect. It always has been.Notwithstanding those folks you hear on the other side there. They’re entitled to be outrageous.This is a democracy.But history and common sense—good manners is nothing they’ve ever suffered from.But history and common sense tell us that opportunity, liberty, and justice for all are most likely to come to pass in a democracy.We have never fully realized the aspirations of our founding, but every generation has opened those doors a little wider to include more people who have been excluded before.My fellow Americans, America is an idea—the most powerful idea in the history of the world.And it beats in the hearts of the people of this country.It beats in all of our hearts. It unites America. It is the American creed.The idea that America guarantees that everyone be treated with dignity. It gives hate no safe harbor.It installs in everyone the belief that no matter where you start in life, there’s nothing you can’t achieve.That’s who we are. That’s what we stand for. That’s what we believe.And that is precisely what we are doing: opening doors, creating new possibilities, focusing on the future. And we’re only just beginning.Our task is to make our nation free and fair, just and strong, noble and whole.And this work is the work of democracy—the work of this generation. It is the work of our time, for all time.We can’t afford to have—leave anyone on the sidelines.We need everyone to do their part. So speak up.Speak out. Get engaged.Vote, vote, vote.And if we all do our duty—if we do our duty in 2022 and beyond, then ages still to come will say we—all of us here—we kept the faith. We preserved democracy. We heeded not our worst instincts but our better angels.And we proved that, for all its imperfections, America is still the beacon to the world, an ideal to be realized, a promise to be kept.There is nothing more important, nothing more sacred, nothing more American.That’s our soul.That’s who we truly are. And that’s who must—we must always be.And I have no doubt—none––that this is who we will be and that we’ll come together as a nation.That we’ll secure our democracy. That for the next 200 years, we’ll have what we had the past 200 years: the greatest nation on the face of the Earth.We just need to remember who we are.We are the United States of America.The United States of America.And may God protect our nation. And may God protect all those who stand watch over our democracy. God bless you all.Democracy. Thank you.',\n",
       " 'Good evening, fellow Americans.I had hoped, when I became President, I would not have to do this again.Another massacre. Uvalde, Texas. An elementary school. Beautiful, innocent second, third, fourth graders. And how many scores of little children who witnessed what happened see their friends die as if they’re on a battlefield, for God’s sake. They’ll live with it the rest of their lives.There’s a lot we don’t know yet, but there’s a lot we do know.There are parents who will never see their child again, never have them jump in bed and cuddle with them. Parents who will never be the same.To lose a child is like having a piece of your soul ripped away. There’s a hollowness in your chest, and you feel like you’re being sucked into it and never going to be able to get out. It’s suffocating. And it’s never quite the same.And it’s a feeling shared by the siblings, and the grandparents, and their family members, and the community that’s left behind.Scripture says—Jill and I have talked about this in different contexts, in other contexts: “The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.” So many crushed spirits.So, tonight, I ask the nation to pray for them, to give the parents and siblings the strength in the darkness they feel right now.As a nation, we have to ask: When in God’s name are we going to stand up to the gun lobby? When in God’s name will we do what we all know in our gut needs to be done?It’s been 340—3,448 days—10 years since I stood up at a high school in Connecticut—a grade school in Connecticut, where another gunman massacred 26 people, including 20 first graders, at Sandy Hook Elementary School.Since then, there have been over 900 incidents of gunfires reported on school grounds.Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Santa Fe High School in Texas. Oxford High School in Michigan. The list goes on and on.And the list grows when it includes mass shootings at places like movie theaters, houses of worship, and, as we saw just 10 days ago, at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York.I am sick and tired of it. We have to act. And don’t tell me we can’t have an impact on this carnage.I spent my career as a senator and as Vice President working to pass commonsense gun laws. We can’t and won’t prevent every tragedy. But we know they work and have a positive impact. When we passed the assault weapons ban, mass shootings went down. When the law expired, mass shootings tripled.The idea that an 18-year-old kid can walk into a gun store and buy two assault weapons is just wrong.What in God’s name do you need an assault weapon for except to kill someone?Deer aren’t running through the forest with Kevlar vests on, for God’s sake. It’s just sick.And the gun manufacturers have spent two decades aggressively marketing assault weapons which make them the most and largest profit.For God’s sake, we have to have the courage to stand up to the industry.Here’s what else I know: Most Americans support commonsense laws—commonsense gun laws.I just got off my trip from Asia, meeting with Asian leaders, and I learned of this while I was on the aircraft. And what struck me on that 17-hour flight—what struck me was these kinds of mass shootings rarely happen anywhere else in the world.Why?They have mental health problems. They have domestic disputes in other countries. They have people who are lost. But these kinds of mass shootings never happen with the kind of frequency that they happen in America. Why?Why are we willing to live with this carnage? Why do we keep letting this happen?Where in God’s name is our backbone to have the courage to deal with it and stand up to the lobbies?\\u2028\\u2028It’s time to turn this pain into action.For every parent, for every citizen in this country, we have to make it clear to every elected official in this country: It’s time to act.It’s time—for those who obstruct or delay or block the commonsense gun laws, we need to let you know that we will not forget.We can do so much more. We have to do more.Our prayer tonight is for those parents, lying in bed and trying to figure out, “Will I be able to sleep again? What do I say to my other children? What happens tomorrow?”\\u2028\\u2028May God bless the loss of innocent life on this sad day. And may the Lord be near the brokenhearted and save those crushed in spirit, because they’re going to need a lot of help and a lot of our prayers.\\u2028\\u2028God love you.']"
